% INTRODUCTION
\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background of the Study}
An inventory is a complete list of stock of some kind of physical commodity and total stocks of various kinds of a firm. It is the quantity of the product that is available to be sold by a merchandising firm at any given time. But  inventory does not only refer to physical merchandise. It can also refer to available seats on flights (airline passsenger reservation system) or slot availability in each class (university/college registration system). \cite{anigbogu11}

An inventory management system, on the other hand, monitors the quantity of available products for sale and maintanance of proper stock levels. It is very convenient for wholesale and retail stores (like the supermarkets) and other businesses to use this kind of system. It can facilitate the management and decision of sales, thus reducing the burden of the business and its managers. \cite{ren13} Also, the work efficiency can be improved as it lessens time and effort of the employees as well as the human errors from manual counting and recording. \cite{rajeswari16} Using an effective and efficient inventory management system is very critical to the over all performance and profitability of many businesses.

Sales and inventory management systems are common nowadays. A lot of sales and inventory managem ent systems were developed for the past years. They have been used in different businesses (especially the big ones) for competitive advantages and for efficiency and effectiveness of the business. Developing it for small-scale and medium-scale businesses will help them improve their operations, management and performance.

\subsection{Significance of the Study}
There are a lot of pawnshops in the Philippines but not all of them uses a management system to handle all their transactions. Most of them, especially the small-scale and medium-scale pawnshop businessess, still transacts with their clients and monitor their sales and inventory manually.This consumes a lot of time and effort for the pawnshop owners and their staff.

The purpose of the project is to create a system that will handle the transactions of a medium-scale pawnshop business like J and M pawnshop. The system will also track and monitor their inventory and sales and generate sales and inventory reports automatically. This will help the pawnshop owners to manage their business efficiently and effectively.

The system will make the transaction easier and secured for both the client and the pawnshop owner. All transaction records will be safe once these are encoded and stored in the database system. The system will have a good password encryption to protect all of its data. Only the administrator and staff with registered account can access the system. It will also be easier for the pawnshop owner (administrator) to generate the Sales and Inventory reports since all computations will be automatically computed based on the database  records. 

The system will also have an SMS Notification Feature. It will be easier for the administrator to notify their clients about their transaction details (like deadline of payment) and other announcements. 

\subsection{Objectives}
Generallly, the objective of he project is to develop a system that will cater to the needs of the medium-scale pawnshop business like J and M Pawnshop. It aims to help the pawnshop owner and administrators to easily monitor their inventory and sales and also to efficiently manage their transactions with their clients.

Specifically, the project aims to accomplish the following objectives:

1. To develop a system that will monitor the inventory and sales of a medium-scale pawnshop business;

2. To automatically generate the sales and inventory reports;

3. To develop an SMS Notification Feature that will be used to notify the clients; and

4. To develop an effective and efficient protocol in handling the business transactions and records.

\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
The system will consist of significant features/modules that will satisfy the business’ needs. These includes the Transaction, Inventory and Sales Modules. There will only be two kind of users (the administrator and the staff) who can use the system. The access will be limited depending on the user/account type. Customers/guest cannot access the system. 

The staff can only View/Update his profile. He can also Add/View/Update/Delete/Search transactions and View/Search list of Admins and Staff. The administrator can do the all staff's functionalities. In addition, he can also Add/Update/Delete list of administrator and staff, manage Sales and Inventory Records and view system logs. The administrator can also generate reports autoomatically. He can also send SMS notifications to customers but cannnot receive SMS from them.

% MATERIALS AND METHODS
\section{Review of Related Literature}
There are already a lot of inventory and sales management systems (and other related systems) that were created for the past years. For example, in the Institute of Computer Science (ICS) at the University of the Philippines Los Banos (UPLB), many students chose to create and develop systems for their Special Problem course. Those systems contributes in the idea of making this project.
	
In 2015, Ruel developed a similar system. She created an inventory and sales information system for a small-scale merchandising business that monitors the inventory and sales of the small grocery store. It also provides the users a conveniet way of handling the business transactions and records. It was implemented using PHP 5.5.12, HTML5, CodeIgniter 2.1.3, MySQL 5.6.17, Wamp Server 2.5 and Bootstrap 3.3.2.


Co (2012), as cited in Ruel’s paper, created an online accounting system a drug company. The system also monitors the inventory and sales of the company efficiently. Ruel also cited in her paper that Caraiga developed an Integrated  Sales and Inventory Management System that efficiently handles the transaction of a drugstore in 2005. \cite{ruel15}

In 2006, Cariño developed a Sales and Product Inventory Management Sytem for Leads Agricultural Product Corporation. The system was implemented using MicrosoftSQL Server 2000 and .NET Framework. I aimed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the business. \cite{carino11}

Implemented using PHP, Javascript, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS and Yii Framewrok, Ong(2014), developed a Web-based Clinic Information and Inventory Management System. The sytem let the user view, add and update the medicines in the clinic. It also made the managing of records and inventory easier. \cite{ong14}
	
A similar system was also developed by San Buenaventura in 2014. He implemented Inventory of Supplies and Materials for Open LGU using Apache Web Server 2.2.22, PHP 5.4.3, Wappstack 5.4.19-0, PostgreSQL 9.0 and Yii 1.1.12. The system keeps track of all the incoming and outgoing resources of the departments. The user can add, view, update and delete supplies and materials. \cite{sanbuenaventura14}
